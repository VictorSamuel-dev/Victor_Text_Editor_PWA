## Description
This Text editor will be a single-page application that runs on the browser. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
